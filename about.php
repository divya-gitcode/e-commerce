                                We are an Indian e-commerce company based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was founded in 2007. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.
The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal. As of March 2017, we held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in us for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.

                           In late 2011, we made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com and the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak.
In February 2012, the company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013.
In May 2012,we acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer. In May 2014, we acquired Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for ₹20 billion (US$280 million). Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while Flipkart itself focuses on the mainstream market and major international brands.
In February 2014, Flipkart partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone. Motorola also partnered with Flipkart on the Moto E—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India. High demand for the phone caused the Flipkart website to crash following its midnight launch on 14 May. Flipkart subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds), the Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late-2014 (which saw similarly accelerated sellouts).
In March 2015, Flipkart blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's mobile app instead.
In April 2015, Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it would use its technology to enhance its mobile services
